    "presentation": "Mercedes’ modern F1 revival started with the creation of a works squad for 2010 - the platform for a meteoric rise up the Grand Prix order. The team generated huge excitement from the off with the sensational return of Michael Schumacher, but headlines soon followed on track: three podiums in their debut season, all via Nico Rosberg - who then claimed a breakthrough pole/victory double at China in 2012. The following season he was paired with Lewis Hamilton, the duo going on to stage some epic title battles as the Silver Arrows swept all before them to become one of the most dominant forces of the modern F1 era. And with Hamilton now partnered by steely Finn Valtteri Bottas, Mercedes remain very much the team to beat…",

    "presentation": "Red Bull were no strangers to F1 - as sponsors - prior to formally entering as a works team in 2004. Nonetheless, the scale of their success over the following decade was staggering. After a first podium in 2006, the team hit their stride in 2009, claiming six victories and second in the constructors' standings. Over the next four seasons they were a tour de force, claiming consecutive title doubles between 2010 and 2013, with Sebastian Vettel emerging as the sport's youngest quadruple champion. Now their hopes of recapturing that glory lie with an equally exciting talent one named Max Verstappen…",
